This is an old project from when I started learning python. 

You can control the player with the arrow keys and use space in menus to select the option you are on.

I have implemented a roaming area, and a battle mechanic, with a basic type system. Battling also rewards exp that levels up your mon.

It's unlikely i will flesh the project out more than it is now tbh.
